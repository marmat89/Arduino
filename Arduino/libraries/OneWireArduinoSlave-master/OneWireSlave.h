	//! Starts listening for the 1-wire master, on the specified pin, as a virtual slave device identified by the specified ROM (7 bytes, starting from the family code, CRC will be computed internally). Reset, Presence, SearchRom and MatchRom are handled automatically. The library will use the external interrupt on the specified pin (note that this is usually not possible with all pins, depending on the board), as well as one hardware timer. Blocking interrupts (either by disabling them explicitely with sei/cli, or by spending time in another interrupt) can lead to malfunction of the library, due to tight timing for some 1-wire operations.

	//! Stops all 1-wire activities, which frees hardware resources for other purposes.

	//! Sets (or replaces) a function to be called when something is received. The callback is executed from interrupts and should be as short as possible. Failure to return quickly can prevent the library from correctly reading the next byte.
	void setReceiveCallback(void(*callback)(ReceiveEvent evt, byte data)) { clientReceiveCallback_ = callback; }

	//! Sets (or replaces) a function to be called when a bit is received. The byte reception callback is called after that if the received bit was the last of a byte. The callback is executed from interrupts and should be as short as possible. Failure to return quickly can prevent the library from correctly reading the next bit.
	void setReceiveBitCallback(void(*callback)(bool bit)) { clientReceiveBitCallback_ = callback; }

	//! Enqueues the specified bytes in the send buffer. They will be sent in the background. The optional callback is used to notify when the bytes are sent, or if an error occured. Callbacks are executed from interrupts and should be as short as possible. If bytes is null or numBytes is 0, nothing is sent, which is equivalent to calling stopWrite. In any case, calling the write function will cancel the previous write operation if it didn't complete yet.
	void write(const byte* bytes, short numBytes, void(*complete)(bool error));

	//! Sets a bit that will be sent next time the master asks for one. Optionnaly, the repeat parameter can be set to true to continue sending the same bit each time. In both cases, the send operation can be canceled by calling stopWrite.
	void writeBit(bool value, bool repeat = false, void(*bitSent)(bool error) = 0);

	//! Cancels any pending write operation, started by writeBit or write. If this function is called before the master asked for a bit, then nothing is sent to the master.
